Exercise 3: More Styles
Let’s build a little off the previous exercise, in which you added multiple classes to a single element in order to apply two different rules to it.

Goals
You should see a black background and white text on the first button element.
You should see a yellow background on the second button element.
You should set a font size of 28px using a selector list.
You should have a list of fonts containing Helvetica and Times New Roman with sans-serif as a fallback in the selector list.
You should see a unique class name on each element.
You should have a selector list for styles that both elements share.
