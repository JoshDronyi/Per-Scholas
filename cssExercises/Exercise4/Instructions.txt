Exercise 4: Selector Chaining
 With this exercise, we’ve provided you a completed HTML file, so you will only have to edit the CSS file. For this exercise, it’s more important to understand how chaining different selectors works than how to actually add the attributes.

 Goals
 You should see a width of 300px on the avatar and proportioned class.
 You should give it a height so that it retains its original square proportions (don’t hardcode in a pixel value for the height!).
 You should give the elements with both the avatar and distorted classes a width of 200px.
 You should give it a height twice as big as it’s width.
